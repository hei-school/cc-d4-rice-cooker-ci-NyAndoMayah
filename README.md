# Rice Cooker Simulator

## Introduction

Welcome to the Rice Cooker Simulator! This console-based program simulates a rice cooker, providing a simple yet interactive experience for users to simulate various rice cooking functionalities.

## Features

### Functionalities

- **Add rice**: Introduces rice into the rice cooker.
- **Cook rice**: Initiates the rice cooking process.
- **Steam**: Commences the steaming process for rice.
- **Keep warm**: Maintains the cooked rice warm.
- **Remove rice**: Clears out the rice from the cooker.
- **Quit**: Exits the simulator.

## Installation and Usage

### Dart `feature/dart`

To utilize this simulator in Dart, ensure you have the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) installed. You can incorporate the Dart linter `dart analyze` by following the instructions provided [here](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-tool).

To run tests for Dart, use the following command:
```bash
dart test path_to_test_file.dart
```

### Ruby `feat/ruby`

For Ruby, ensure you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) installed on your system. Follow the guidelines to install a suitable linter for Ruby.

```bash
gem install rspec
```
Run RSpec tests:
```bash
rspec path_to_spec_file.rb
```

### TypeScript `feat/typescript`

If you're working with TypeScript, set up the ESLint linter by referring to the documentation available [here](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started).
1. Ensure you have npm installed.
2. Add test scripts in your package.json:
```bash
"scripts": {
  "test": "your_test_command"
}
```
3. Run tests
```bash
npm test
```

### JavaScript `feat/js`

If you're working with TypeScript, set up the ESLint linter by referring to the documentation available [here](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started).
1. Ensure you have npm installed.
2. Add test scripts in your package.json:
```bash
"scripts": {
  "test": "your_test_command"
}
```
3. Run tests
```bash
npm test
```
#### Fortunately for you, I've already followed those instructions and put it in the repository, all you have to do for JS and TS is to run npm test.

## Roadmap

### Upcoming Features

- Implementation to cook items other than rice for steaming purposes.
- Functionality to add water before adding rice for improved cooking simulation.
